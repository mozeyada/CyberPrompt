GRC Medium Prompt (400-500 tokens):
------------------------------------
"Assess current implementation status of NIST SP 800-53 AC-2 (Account Management) for Q1 2024 audit preparation. Organization: 500 employees, hybrid cloud environment (AWS, Azure), Active Directory primary identity provider. Current controls: automated provisioning, quarterly access reviews, MFA for privileged accounts. Audit scope: privileged access management, service account lifecycle, access review processes. Identify gaps and provide remediation priorities with implementation timeline."

GRC Long Prompt (750-850 tokens):
---------------------------------
"Assess comprehensive implementation status of NIST SP 800-53 AC-2 (Account Management) for Q1 2024 audit preparation. Organization: 500 employees across 3 locations, hybrid cloud environment (AWS, Azure, on-premises), Active Directory primary identity provider with Azure AD Connect. Current controls: automated provisioning via HR system integration, quarterly access reviews, MFA for privileged accounts, privileged access management (PAM) solution. Audit scope: privileged access management, service account lifecycle, access review processes, identity governance, compliance reporting. Stakeholders: CISO, IT Director, Internal Audit, External Auditor (Deloitte). Regulatory context: SOX compliance, industry-specific requirements. Identify gaps and provide detailed remediation priorities with implementation timeline, resource requirements, and risk mitigation strategies."

C3: CTI Analysis Prompts
========================

CTI Short Prompt (150-200 tokens):
----------------------------------
"Analyze APT29 Cobalt Strike beacon configuration for attribution assessment. Focus on C2 infrastructure patterns and evasion techniques."

CTI Medium Prompt (400-500 tokens):
-----------------------------------
"Analyze APT29 Cobalt Strike beacon configuration discovered in recent campaign targeting financial institutions. Beacon characteristics: sleep interval 60s, jitter 20%, staging protocol HTTP/HTTPS. C2 infrastructure: compromised WordPress sites, dynamic DNS providers. Evasion techniques: process hollowing, DLL sideloading, encrypted communications. Attribution indicators: Russian language artifacts, Moscow timezone, specific TTPs. Provide attribution assessment with confidence level and supporting evidence."

CTI Long Prompt (750-850 tokens):
----------------------------------
"Analyze comprehensive APT29 Cobalt Strike beacon configuration discovered in recent campaign targeting financial institutions across North America and Europe. Beacon characteristics: sleep interval 60s, jitter 20%, staging protocol HTTP/HTTPS, custom malleable C2 profile. C2 infrastructure: compromised WordPress sites, dynamic DNS providers (no-ip.com, duckdns.org), bulletproof hosting providers. Evasion techniques: process hollowing, DLL sideloading, encrypted communications, anti-VM checks, sandbox evasion. Attribution indicators: Russian language artifacts, Moscow timezone (UTC+3), specific TTPs matching historical APT29 campaigns, code similarities to previous samples. Campaign context: targeting SWIFT systems, financial messaging platforms, treasury management systems. Provide detailed attribution assessment with confidence level, supporting evidence, threat actor profile, campaign timeline, and recommended countermeasures."
