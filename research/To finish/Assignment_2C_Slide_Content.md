## Slide 2: Research Question (Original and Revised)

### Original Research Question (RQ1)
**"How does prompt length influence LLM output quality and cost efficiency in SOC/GRC tasks?"**

### Revised Research Question
**No change** - The research question remains the same

### Explanation of Refinement
While the research question was well-scoped from the start, the **methodology was refined from v3 to v4** to implement a proper controlled experiment:

**v3 Issue**: Different tasks for S/M/L variants (introduced confounding variables)
**v4 Fix**: Identical tasks across all lengths, only context detail varies

This ensures RQ1 can properly measure **"where quality gains plateau"**

### Why No Change?
The question accurately captures the core research objective. The refinement was **methodological, not conceptual** - ensuring scientific rigor in experimental design.

## Slide 4: Dataset Development Results

### Table 1: Dataset Composition
| Scenario Type | Base Prompts | Total Prompts | Categories |
|---------------|--------------|---------------|------------|
| SOC_INCIDENT | 50 | 150 | 5 (Ransomware, BEC, APT, Cloud, Insider) |
| GRC_MAPPING | 30 | 90 | 3 (GDPR, SOX, Framework) |
| CTI_SUMMARY | 20 | 60 | 3 (Profiling, IOC, Strategic) |
| **Total** | **100** | **300** | **11** |

### Figure 1: Token Distribution by Length Variant
**Bar Chart**: [Use token_distribution_chart.png]

- **S**: 150-195 tokens (avg 165)
- **M**: 324-550 tokens (avg 471) 
- **L**: 510-891 tokens (avg 798)
- **Clear separation** confirms controlled experiment design

### Key Achievement
**Controlled experiment validation**: 0 task consistency errors across all 100 base scenarios

### Figure 2: Scenario Distribution
**Pie Chart**: [Use scenario_distribution_chart.png]
