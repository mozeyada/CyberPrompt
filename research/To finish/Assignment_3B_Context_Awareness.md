## 🎯 **Research Value Proposition (Refined)**

### **The Real Research Contribution**
This research is NOT about finding dramatic quality differences between prompt lengths. Instead, it's about **context-dependent optimization** in cybersecurity AI deployment.

### **Key Insight from Actual Results**
- **Quality-First Approach**: Focus on achieving the highest quality outputs with optimal efficiency
- **Modest Quality Differences**: Actual experimental results show modest quality differences (as you mentioned)
- **Diminishing Returns**: Significant cost differences (+185% tokens) for minimal quality improvement (+2-3.5%)
- **Critical Finding**: The research value lies in demonstrating that longer prompts provide diminishing returns
- **Real Value**: Context-dependent optimization - different cybersecurity tasks may require different approaches

### **Why This Is Valuable**
1. **Challenges Industry Assumption**: "Longer prompts = better results" is NOT universally true
2. **Context-Specific Optimization**: SOC vs GRC vs CTI tasks need different approaches
3. **Quality Optimization Framework**: How to achieve maximum quality with optimal efficiency
4. **Prompt Shaping Insights**: How to structure prompts for different cybersecurity scenarios

---

## 📋 **Research Positioning Strategy**

### **Primary Research Question (Refined)**
"How does prompt length and structure influence LLM output quality across different SOC/GRC operational contexts, and how can we achieve maximum quality with optimal efficiency?"

### **Key Research Findings to Emphasize**
1. **Context-Dependent Optimization**: Different cybersecurity tasks require different AI strategies
2. **Multi-Model Validation**: Results tested across GPT-4, Claude, and other leading LLMs
