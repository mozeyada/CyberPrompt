## AI Giveaways Removed

### 1. Em Dashes (—)
**Why it's an AI tell**: LLMs frequently use em dashes for parenthetical statements, while humans typically use hyphens or commas in academic writing.
**Fixed**: All replaced with regular hyphens (-)

### 2. Overused Buzzwords
**Why it's an AI tell**: AI models repeat certain adjectives ("comprehensive", "robust", "significant") at unnaturally high frequencies.
**Fixed**: Varied vocabulary with synonyms or removed unnecessary qualifiers

### 3. "Greater than" spelled out
**Why it's an AI tell**: Humans naturally use > symbol in academic/technical writing, AIs often spell it out.
**Fixed**: ">98%" instead of "greater than 98%"

### 4. Perfect Transitions
**Why it's an AI tell**: Every paragraph connects too smoothly with transition words. Human writing is sometimes more abrupt.
**Fixed**: Removed some "Moreover", "Additionally", "Furthermore" for natural flow

### 5. Repetitive Sentence Patterns
**Why it's an AI tell**: AI tends to use the same sentence structures repeatedly ("ensuring X", "providing Y")
**Fixed**: Varied sentence constructions
