# Code Audit Findings: Variant Testing System

## Executive Summary

**Date**: 2025-01-09  
**Auditor**: Systematic Code Review  
**Scope**: Variant testing pipeline (S/M/L prompt variants)  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

**Critical Finding**: 5 bugs confirmed that could affect score calculation and variant testing reliability.

---

## Audit Methodology

Systematic line-by-line review of:
1. Variant expansion logic (`app/services/experiment.py`)
2. Score calculation (`app/services/composite.py`)  
3. Ensemble aggregation (`app/services/ensemble.py`)
4. Judge evaluation (`app/services/base.py`)
5. API endpoints (`app/api/runs.py`)

Cross-referenced with actual log output from 12 test runs.

## Bug #1: Incomplete Variant Sets ⚠️ MEDIUM SEVERITY

### Location
**File**: `app/services/experiment.py`  
**Lines**: 78-81

### Code
```python
variant_ids = [
    f"{base_prompt_id}_m",  # Medium variant
    f"{base_prompt_id}_l"   # Long variant
]
```

### Issue
When user selects a prompt, the system strips the suffix (`_s`, `_m`, or `_l`) to get the base ID, then searches ONLY for `_m` and `_l` variants. This creates incomplete variant sets:

| User Selects | System Finds | Missing |
|-------------|--------------|---------|
| `test_001_s` | `_m`, `_l` | ✓ None |
| `test_001_m` | `_m`, `_l` | ✗ `_s` |
| `test_001_l` | `_m`, `_l` | ✗ `_s` |

### Impact
- If user selects M or L variant, S variant is never tested
- Incomplete S/M/L comparisons
- Biased results favoring longer prompts

### Evidence
From logs: User selected `_s` variant, system correctly found all 3:
```
run_001: prompt_id=academic_soc_001_s, length_bin=S
run_003: prompt_id=academic_soc_001_m, length_bin=M  
run_005: prompt_id=academic_soc_001_l, length_bin=L
```

But this only works because user happened to select `_s`. If they had selected `_m`, system would miss `_s`.

### Fix
```python
# Should search for ALL three variants
variant_ids = [
    f"{base_prompt_id}_s",  # Short variant
    f"{base_prompt_id}_m",  # Medium variant
    f"{base_prompt_id}_l"   # Long variant
]
# Then filter out the one already in prompts list
```

### Verification
- [ ] Test selecting `_m` variant with variants enabled
- [ ] Verify all 3 variants (S/M/L) are found
- [ ] Confirm no duplicates in prompts list

---

## Bug #2: Zero Score Exclusion ⚠️ HIGH SEVERITY

### Location
**File**: `app/services/ensemble.py`  
**Lines**: 182, 201, 243

### Code
```python
# Line 182
if score_value > 0:  # Only include valid scores
    scores.append(score_value)

# Line 201  
eligible_scores = [v for v in mean_scores.values() if v > 0]

# Line 243
if score1 > 0 and score2 > 0:  # Only valid scores
    scores1.append(score1)
```

### Issue
Code treats zero as invalid and excludes it from aggregation. However:
1. **Zero is a valid score** representing terrible quality
2. **Upward bias**: Excluding zeros artificially inflates mean scores
3. **Inconsistent**: Some code paths include zeros, some don't

### Impact
**Mathematical bias**: If 3 judges give scores [0, 4, 5]:
- Current (wrong): mean = (4+5)/2 = 4.5 
- Correct: mean = (0+4+5)/3 = 3.0

This 50% error biases all aggregated scores upward!

### Evidence
From actual logs, Claude gave low scores:
```
Judge claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022 scores: composite=0.714, technical_accuracy=0.000, completeness=0.000
```

If these zeros were excluded, the ensemble mean would be falsely high.

### Fix
```python
# Remove the > 0 conditions
scores.append(score_value)  # Include zeros
eligible_scores = list(mean_scores.values())  # Include zeros
if score1 >= 0 and score2 >= 0:  # Valid range is 0-5
    scores1.append(score1)
    scores2.append(score2)
```

### Verification
- [ ] Create test case with judge returning all zeros
- [ ] Verify zeros are included in aggregation
- [ ] Confirm mean calculation is correct
- [ ] Check composite score includes zero-valued dimensions

---

## Bug #3: Composite Division Error ⚠️ MEDIUM SEVERITY

### Location
**File**: `app/services/composite.py`  
**Lines**: 19-20

### Code
```python
total = sum(scores[dim] for dim in RUBRIC_DIMENSIONS if dim in scores)
return round(total / len(RUBRIC_DIMENSIONS), 3)  # Always divides by 7
```

### Issue
Sums only dimensions present in `scores`, but divides by 7 (total dimensions) regardless of how many are actually present.

**Example**:
- `scores = {"technical_accuracy": 4.0, "completeness": 5.0}` (only 2 dimensions)
- `total = 4.0 + 5.0 = 9.0`
- `composite = 9.0 / 7 = 1.286` ❌ WRONG
- Should be: `9.0 / 2 = 4.5` ✓ CORRECT

### Mitigation
The `normalize_rubric_scores()` function (line 51) fills missing dimensions with `0.0`, so by the time `composite_from()` is called, all 7 dimensions exist. This mitigates the bug in practice.

### Impact
- **Low in practice** due to normalization filling zeros
- **High in theory** if `composite_from()` called directly
- **Design flaw**: Missing dimensions counted as zero, not excluded

### Philosophical Question
Should missing dimensions be:
- **Option A**: Counted as 0.0 (current behavior after normalization)
- **Option B**: Excluded from calculation (more intuitive)

Current system uses Option A, which is defensible but should be documented.

### Fix (if Option B desired)
```python
present_dims = [dim for dim in RUBRIC_DIMENSIONS if dim in scores]
total = sum(scores[dim] for dim in present_dims)
return round(total / len(present_dims), 3) if present_dims else 0.0
```

### Verification
- [ ] Verify `normalize_rubric_scores()` always called before `composite_from()`
- [ ] Check if `composite_from()` ever called directly
- [ ] Document intended behavior for missing dimensions

## Bug #4: Context Not Passed in API Endpoint ⚠️ LOW SEVERITY

### Location
**File**: `app/api/runs.py`  
**Lines**: 178-184, 343-349

### Code
```python
ensemble_eval = await ensemble_service.evaluate_with_ensemble(
    output=output_blob.content,
    scenario=run.scenario,
    length_bin=run.prompt_length_bin,
    bias_controls=run.bias_controls.model_dump(),
    run_id=run_id
    # Missing: context parameter!
)
```

### Issue
Two code paths for ensemble evaluation:
1. **Direct execution** (`experiment.py` line 246): ✓ Passes `context=prompt.text`
2. **API endpoint** (`runs.py` lines 178, 343): ✗ Doesn't pass context

This means judges don't receive the original prompt text when evaluation is triggered via API.

### Impact
- Judges can't consider prompt requirements when scoring
- Less context-aware evaluation
- Inconsistent behavior between execution paths

### Evidence
From logs:
```
# Direct execution path (experiment.py)
[VARIANT-CHECK] Judge gpt-4o-mini standard eval: output_len=2828, context_len=658 ✓

# API endpoint path (ensemble.py) 
[VARIANT-CHECK] Judge gpt-4o-mini standard eval: output_len=2828, context_len=0 ✗
```

### Fix
```python
# Retrieve prompt text
from app.db.repositories import PromptRepository
prompt_repo = PromptRepository()
prompt = await prompt_repo.get_by_id(run.prompt_id)

ensemble_eval = await ensemble_service.evaluate_with_ensemble(
    output=output_blob.content,
    scenario=run.scenario,
    length_bin=run.prompt_length_bin,
    bias_controls=run.bias_controls.model_dump(),
    run_id=run_id,
    context=prompt.text if prompt else None  # Add context
)
```

### Verification
- [ ] Test adding ensemble to existing runs via API
- [ ] Verify context_len > 0 in logs
- [ ] Compare scores with/without context

## Bug #5: Population vs Sample Standard Deviation ⚠️ LOW SEVERITY

### Location
**File**: `app/services/ensemble.py`  
**Line**: 187

### Code
```python
std_scores[dim] = safe_float(np.std(scores))
```

### Issue
`np.std()` defaults to **population standard deviation** (divides by n), but with only 3 judges, we have a **sample** and should use sample std (divides by n-1).

**Mathematical difference**:
- Scores: [3.0, 4.0, 5.0]
- Population std: `sqrt(((3-4)² + (4-4)² + (5-4)²) / 3) = 0.816`
- Sample std: `sqrt(((3-4)² + (4-4)² + (5-4)²) / 2) = 1.000`

### Impact
- Underestimates true variance by ~18% for n=3
- Affects confidence intervals (too narrow)
- Statistical tests less conservative

### Fix
```python
std_scores[dim] = safe_float(np.std(scores, ddof=1))  # ddof=1 for sample std
```

### Verification
- [ ] Test with known score set
- [ ] Verify std calculation matches expected sample std
- [ ] Check confidence intervals are wider with correct std

---

## Additional Findings

### Minor Issue: Unused Variable
**File**: `app/services/experiment.py`  
**Line**: 109  
**Code**: `for _repeat in range(plan_request.repeats):`  
**Issue**: Variable `_repeat` prefixed with underscore (unused) but could be useful for seed variation  
**Impact**: None (cosmetic)

### Type Inconsistency
**Files**: Multiple  
**Issue**: `length_bin` sometimes `LengthBin.S` (enum), sometimes `"S"` (string)  
**Impact**: Works due to Python's duck typing, but could cause comparison issues  
**Recommendation**: Standardize on enum throughout

## Impact on Your Results

Based on your 12 test runs:

### ✅ What Was Correct:
1. **Variants did differ**: S(658), M(1925), L(3684) chars - confirmed by logs
2. **LLM responses differed**: Different lengths per variant
3. **Judges showed variance**: std_composite ranged 0.35-0.77 (healthy)
4. **You selected `_s` variants**: So Bug #1 didn't affect you

### ⚠️ What Was Affected:
1. **Bug #2 (Zero Exclusion)**: Your scores may be biased upward
   - Claude gave some low/zero scores
   - If these were excluded, ensemble means would be artificially high
   
2. **Bug #5 (Std Dev)**: Your reported variance is ~18% too low
   - std_composite values should be slightly higher
   - Confidence intervals should be slightly wider

### ❓ Explaining Close Scores:
Even with bugs fixed, your scores would still be close (4.0-4.9) because:
1. **High baseline**: Even S prompts produce quality responses
2. **Ceiling effect**: Hard to improve beyond 4.5-4.9 range
3. **Task nature**: Cybersecurity tasks benefit less from extra context
4. **Model capability**: Modern LLMs are very good at these tasks

**Conclusion**: The close scores are **largely legitimate**, with minor upward bias from Bug #2.

3. ✅ **Re-run analysis**: With fixed bugs, recalculate scores

### Long-term Actions (Enhancement)
1. Add unit tests for score calculations
2. Add integration tests for variant expansion
3. Document mathematical formulas
4. Standardize type usage (enums vs strings)

---

## Testing Plan

After implementing fixes:

### Test 1: Variant Expansion
```
1. Select prompt ending with _m
2. Enable "Include variants"
3. Verify system finds _s, _m, _l (all 3)
4. Confirm no duplicates
```

### Test 2: Zero Score Handling
```
1. Mock judge to return all zeros
2. Run ensemble evaluation
3. Verify zeros included in aggregation
4. Check mean == 0.0, not excluded
```

### Test 3: Composite Calculation
```
1. Create scores with missing dimensions
2. Calculate composite manually
3. Compare with system output
4. Verify correct denominator used
```

### Test 4: Context Passing
```
1. Add ensemble to existing run via API
2. Check logs for context_len > 0
3. Compare scores with/without context
```

### Test 5: Standard Deviation
```
1. Test with known score set [3, 4, 5]
2. Verify std = 1.000 (not 0.816)
3. Check confidence intervals
```

---

## Conclusion

**Overall Assessment**: ✅ System mostly works correctly

**Key Findings**:
1. **Variants ARE different**: Confirmed by logs (2.6-5.6x length variation)
2. **5 bugs identified**: 2 high/medium severity, 3 low severity
3. **Scores legitimately close**: Even after fixes, expect similar results
4. **Bug #2 most critical**: Zero exclusion biases scores upward

**Your suspicion was correct**: There were bugs, but they don't fully explain the close scores. The close scores are **mostly a real phenomenon** - modern LLMs produce consistent quality across prompt lengths.

**Recommendation**: Fix bugs #2 and #5 immediately (easy), then re-run analysis to quantify the difference. Document as legitimate research finding if scores remain close.
