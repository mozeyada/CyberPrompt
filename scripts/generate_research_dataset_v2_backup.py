Academic-Grade Cybersecurity Prompt Generation for CyberPrompt Research

This script generates research-quality prompts using:
1. BOTS v3 dataset (real security data)
2. NIST SP 800-53 controls (compliance framework)
3. Operationally realistic token ranges

Token ranges are based on actual SOC/GRC/CTI operational workflows:
- SHORT (250-350): Tactical responses during active incidents (SOC L1/L2)
- MEDIUM (350-500): Analytical investigation plans (SOC L3/IR teams)
- LONG (600-750): Strategic executive briefings (CISO/Board/Regulators)

Designed for RQ1 (prompt length impact) and RQ2 (cost-effectiveness analysis)
