## ðŸ”¬ Research Summary

### Key Findings
- **Context-Dependent Optimization**: Different cybersecurity tasks require different prompt strategies
- **Diminishing Returns**: 15.7:1 cost-to-quality ratio for Mediumâ†’Long transition
- **Quality Plateau**: Modest quality improvements (+1.88%) with significant cost increases (+35.5%)
- **Practical Framework**: 67% token reduction while maintaining 99.7% quality retention

### Experimental Design
- **Dataset**: 300 cybersecurity prompts across 3 length variants
- **Domains**: SOC incident response, GRC compliance, CTI analysis
- **Evaluation**: 3-judge ensemble with 7-dimension quality rubric
- **Models**: GPT-4, Claude-3.5-Sonnet, Gemini-1.5-Pro

### Statistical Analysis
- **Test**: Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric test (H=7.07, p=0.029)
- **Effect Sizes**: Cohen's d with 95% confidence intervals
- **Corrections**: Bonferroni corrections for multiple comparisons
- **Ceiling Effects**: 69.7% scores near maximum, negative skewness (-0.32)
